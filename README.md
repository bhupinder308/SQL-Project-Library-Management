# Library Management System ðŸ“š

The Library Management System is a SQL-based project designed to streamline and manage library operations efficiently. The system organizes and tracks essential data related to library branches, books, employees, book issuance, and returns.

## Key Features:-
- *Branch Management:* Information about library branches and their locations.
- *Book Catalog:* Details of books, including ISBN numbers, rental - amounts, and availability status.
- *Employee Records:* Information about library staff and their roles.
- *Issue Tracking:* Records of book issuances to members.
- *Return Monitoring:* Tracks the return status of issued books.

This project provides a structured database schema that ensures - seamless handling of library operations while maintaining data integrity.

##Schema Creation

Create Branch table
```sql
create table branch (   

	branch_id varchar(10)primary key,
	manager_id varchar(10),
	branch_address varchar(55),
	contact_no 	 varchar(55)
);
```

	branch_id  varchar(10)
);
```

	publisher varchar(30)
);
```


Create issued table

```sql
alter table issued_status add constraint issued_status_FK_books 
	foreign key(issued_book_isbn) references books(isbn) on delete cascade on update cascade;  

alter table issued_status add constraint issued_status_FK_members
foreign key (issued_member_id) references members(member_id) on delete cascade on update cascade;  


alter table issued_status add constraint issued_status_FK_employees
foreign key(issued_emp_id) references  employees(emp_id)  on delete cascade on update cascade;  

alter table employees add constraint employees_FK_branch
foreign key(branch_id)  references branch(branch_id)   on delete cascade on update cascade;   

alter table return_status add constraint return_status_FK_issued_status
foreign key(issued_id) references issued_status(issued_id) on delete cascade on update cascade;
```

-- Procedure test
-- Its isbn is "978-0-307-58837-1"

-- Checking the working of procedure for issued_id IS135 from issued_status in books its status is 'no'

select * from books where isbn='978-0-307-58837-1';  -- book status is no


select * from issued_status where issued_book_isbn='978-0-307-58837-1'; -- book was issued on "2024-04-08"


select * from return_status where return_book_isbn='978-0-307-58837-1';  -- return book not showing that this book is returned

call add_return_record('RS138', 'IS135','Good');


select * from books where isbn='978-0-307-58837-1';  -- Now the status of the book is showing as Yes. 
select * from return_status where issued_id='IS135';  -- return status is showing that the book is returned. 


```

Task 15

join 
employees e on b.branch_id = e.branch_id
join issued_status ist
on ist.issued_emp_id = e.emp_id
left join 
return_status rst on ist.issued_id = rst.issued_id

from employees emp
join issued_status ist on emp.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id group by emp.emp_name order by count(ist.issued_id) desc)
 where emp_rank<=3;

-- Insight:- There are 6 employees which comes in top 3 performers
```

Task 18 
Stored Procedure Objective: Create a stored procedure to manage the status of books in a library system. 
Description: Write a stored procedure that updates the status of a book in the library based on its issuance. 
The procedure should function as follows: The stored procedure should take the book_id as an input parameter. 
The procedure should first check if the book is available (status = 'yes'). 
If the book is available, it should be issued, and the status in the books table should be updated to 'no'. 
If the book is not available (status = 'no'), the procedure should return an error message indicating that the book is currently not available.

```sql
 create or replace procedure issue_book(p_issued_id varchar(6), p_issued_member_id varchar(6),p_issued_book_isbn varchar(25),p_issued_emp_id varchar(6))
language plpgsql

as $$

declare
	 v_status varchar(5);

begin
-- Checking if the book is available 
	 select status into v_status from books where isbn= p_issued_book_isbn;

if
v_status='yes' then
	insert into issued_status(issued_id, issued_member_id,issued_date,issued_book_isbn,issued_emp_id)
	values(p_issued_id,  p_issued_member_id ,to_date('2024-08-23','YYYY-MM-DD'), p_issued_book_isbn, p_issued_emp_id);	

	update books set status='no' where isbn= p_issued_book_isbn;

	raise notice 'Book Issued successfully  %', p_issued_book_isbn;

else

	raise notice 'Book Not available  %', p_issued_book_isbn;

end if;

end;

$$

-- Testing Procedure

-- We are checkign if the "978-0-553-29698-2" book is available currently its status is yes
-- Then we will check it for the book "978-0-375-41398-8" and currently its status is no.

call issue_book('IS155','C108','978-0-553-29698-2','E104'); -- Procedure works 


select status from books where isbn='978-0-553-29698-2'; -- shows that the status of the book is now updated as 'no'

call issue_book('IS155','C108','978-0-375-41398-8','E104');-- procedure successfully displaying 'Book Not available  978-0-375-41398-8'
